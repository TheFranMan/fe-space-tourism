## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - Testing framework
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - Client side routing

### What I learned

Used React Router for the first time. Reliased that this is not the best way to apprach this project, a traditional html page approach would have been better. It was a good opportunity to get some expeience with React Router though. Quickly learnt that it is not very a11y friendly, it required a very hacky approach to get screen readers to announce when a new page was loaded.

Used Cypress for end-to-end testing for the first time, was very impressed. There was a bit of a learning curve at the start, but things fell into place quickly.

### Continued development

Going to continue with Cypress for testing. I found it very powerfull and usefull.

### Useful resources

- [Accessible Routing in React](https://timwright.org/blog/2019/03/23/accessible-routing-in-react/) - This helped turn React Router into something accesible.
